This App helps to visualize the convergence in probability.

1. There are 3 distributions implemented: Normal, Exponential and Lognormal.
2. The parameter were selected to have approximately the same mean and variance, 10 and 100, respectively.
3. Select the sample size n, so you can visualize the convergence when n is increased.
4. Select the number simulations, most of the plotted series should end up closer to 10.
5. The simulations that end up outside a neighborhood of radius epsilon are colored in red.
